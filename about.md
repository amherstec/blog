Founded in the spring of 2012, the Amherst College Electronics Club provides an opportunity for students to learn about embedded electronics and develop team projects. We designed a simple robot in the beginning of 2013, we launched Project Daedalus, built LED cubes, and hopefully many other projects will come to life through the club.
